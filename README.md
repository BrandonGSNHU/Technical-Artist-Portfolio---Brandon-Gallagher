This repository highlights my current work as a technical artist. Within my Unreal project I have finished and ready to use tools such as a Fresnel, Gradient, UV Grid Debug, Transform master and instance, as well as my first high level material, lava.
I will continue to post more updates to my portfolio on the materials and work I create and the tools I master. Learning and understanding the fundamentals of materials and UVs are the first stepping stones to creating advanced and beautiful materials for video games.
Please check back soon and thank you for taking the time visit my portfolio.
